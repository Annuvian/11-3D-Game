This is my mini-golf game.
OBJECTIVE:
When you hit the yellow floating spinning cubes it will disappear and you will be teleported to the next hole.
Your overall score will be kept as you play and is based on the number of strokes it takes you to finish all the holes.
CONTROLS:
Move the camera with the mouse, it will orbit around the ball.
Adjust how hard to hit the ball with numbers 1-9 before you putt. 1 is the softest hit, 9 is the hardest.
Left click the mouse to hit the ball. The ball will go in the direction the camera is facing.
Good luck!
